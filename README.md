This is a fairly simple little board targetted at the BeagleV, but likely usable for anything that uses a 2x20 pin header.

The board takes the existing 2x20 header and either via a through-hole, or smt, header extends it away from the board
(assuming the connetor is on the edge, and rotates it 180deg so if you happen to have a large heat sink, or something
else that's blocking the pins they might still be accessible for hats, etc
